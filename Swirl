| When you are at the R prompt (>):
| -- Typing skip() allows you to skip the current question.
| -- Typing play() lets you experiment with R on your own; swirl will ignore what you do...
| -- UNTIL you type nxt() which will regain swirl's attention.
| -- Typing bye() causes swirl to exit. Your progress will be saved.
| -- Typing main() returns you to swirl's main menu.
| -- Typing info() displays these options again.

| If at any point you'd like more information on a particular topic related to R, you can type help.start() at the prompt, which will open a menu of resources (either within RStudio
| or your default web browser, depending on your setup). Alternatively, a simple web search often yields the answer you're looking for.

| Anytime you have questions about a particular function, you can access R's built-in help files via the `?` command. For example, if you want more information on the c() function,
| type ?c without the parentheses that normally follow a function name. Give it a try.

The output type is determined from the highest type of the components in the hierarchy NULL < raw < logical < integer < double < complex < character < list < expression. Pairlists are treated as lists, but non-vector components (such names and calls) are treated as one-element lists which cannot be unlisted even if recursive = TRUE.

file.info("mytest.R")$mode
file.rename("mytest.R", "mytest2.R")
file.copy("mytest2.R","mytest3.R")
file.path("mytest3.R")

| You can use file.path to construct file and directory paths that are independent of the operating system your R code is
| running on. Pass 'folder1' and 'folder2' as arguments to file.path to make a platform-independent pathname.

> file.path("folder1", "folder2")
[1] "folder1/folder2"

?dir.create
dir.create(file.path("testdir2", "testdir3"), recursive=TRUE)

unlink("testdir2", recursive = TRUE)

### Sequence of numbers

pi:10
15:1
?`:`
seq(1,20)
seq(0, 10, by=0.5)
seq(5, 10, length=30)
my_seq <- seq(5, 10, length=30)
length(my_seq)
1:length(my_seq)
seq(along.with = my_seq)
seq_along(my_seq)
rep(0, times=40)
rep(c(0, 1, 2), times = 10)
rep(c(0, 1, 2), each = 10)

### Vectors

| In previous lessons, we dealt entirely with numeric vectors, which are one type of atomic vector. Other types of atomic
| vectors include logical, character, integer, and complex. In this lesson, we'll take a closer look at logical and
| character vectors.

num_vect <- c(0.5, 55, -10, 6)
tf <- num_vect < 1

| If we have two logical expressions, A and B, we can ask whether at least one is TRUE with A | B (logical 'or' a.k.a.
| 'union') or whether they are both TRUE with A & B (logical 'and' a.k.a. 'intersection'). Lastly, !A is the negation of
| A and is TRUE when A is FALSE and vice versa.

my_char <- c("My", "name", "is")
paste(my_char, collapse = " ")
my_name <- c(my_char, "Ray")
paste("Hello", "world!", sep = " ")

> paste(c(1:3), c("X", "Y", "Z"), sep="")
[1] "1X" "2Y" "3Z"

| Vector recycling! Try paste(LETTERS, 1:4, sep = "-"), where LETTERS is a predefined variable in R containing a
| character vector of all 26 letters in the English alphabet.

> paste(LETTERS, 1:4, sep = "-")
 [1] "A-1" "B-2" "C-3" "D-4" "E-1" "F-2" "G-3" "H-4" "I-1" "J-2" "K-3" "L-4" "M-1" "N-2" "O-3" "P-4" "Q-1" "R-2" "S-3"
[20] "T-4" "U-1" "V-2" "W-3" "X-4" "Y-1" "Z-2"

### Missing values

x <- c(44, NA, 5, NA)

| To make things a little more interesting, lets create a vector containing 1000 draws from a standard normal
| distribution with y <- rnorm(1000).

> y <- rnorm(1000)

| Next, let's create a vector containing 1000 NAs with z <- rep(NA, 1000).

> z <- rep(NA, 1000)

| Finally, let's select 100 elements at random from these 2000 values (combining y and z) such that we don't know how
| many NAs we'll wind up with or what positions they'll occupy in our final vector -- my_data <- sample(c(y, z), 100).

> my_data <- sample(c(y, z), 100)

| Let's first ask the question of where our NAs are located in our data. The is.na() function tells us whether each
| element of a vector is NA. Call is.na() on my_data and assign the result to my_na.

> my_na <- is.na(my_data)

| So, back to the task at hand. Now that we have a vector, my_na, that has a TRUE for every NA and FALSE for every
| numeric value, we can compute the total number of NAs in our data.

| The trick is to recognize that underneath the surface, R represents TRUE as the number 1 and FALSE as the number 0.
| Therefore, if we take the sum of a bunch of TRUEs and FALSEs, we get the total number of TRUEs.

| Let's give that a try here. Call the sum() function on my_na to count the total number of TRUEs in my_na, and thus the
| total number of NAs in my_data. Don't assign the result to a new variable.

> sum(my_na)
[1] 51

INf - Inf --> NaN
0 / 0 --> NaN

# Subsetting Vectors

x[1:10]
x[is.na(x)]
y <- x[!is.na(x)]
y[y>0]
x[!is.na(x) & x>0]
x[c(3,5,7)]

| Luckily, R accepts negative integer indexes. Whereas x[c(2, 10)] gives us ONLY the 2nd and 10th elements of x, x[c(-2,
| -10)] gives us all elements of x EXCEPT for the 2nd and 10 elements.  Try x[c(-2, -10)] now to see this.

> x[c(-2, -10)]

| Create a numeric vector with three named elements using vect <- c(foo = 11, bar = 2, norf = NA).

> vect <- c(foo = 11, bar = 2, norf = NA)
names(vect)
vect2 <- c(11, 2, NA)
names(vect2) <- c("foo", "bar", "norf")
> identical(vect, vect2)
[1] TRUE
vect["bar"]


# 7: Matrices and Data Frames

| In this lesson, we'll cover matrices and data frames. Both represent 'rectangular' data types, meaning that they are
| used to store tabular data, with rows and columns.

| The main difference, as you'll see, is that matrices can only contain a single class of data, while data frames can
| consist of many different classes of data.

my_vector <- 1:20

> dim(my_vector)
NULL

> length(my_vector)
[1] 20

dim(my_vector) <- c(4, 5)

> dim(my_vector)

> attributes(my_vector)

| Like the which() function, the functions any() and all() take logical vectors as their argument. The any() function
| will return TRUE if one or more of the elements in the logical vector is TRUE. The all() function will return TRUE if
| every element in the logical vector is TRUE.
